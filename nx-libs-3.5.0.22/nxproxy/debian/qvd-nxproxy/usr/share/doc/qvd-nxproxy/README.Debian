nxproxy for Debian
------------------

nxproxy is part of the NX X compression system. It is part of the GPL NX
components provided by NoMachine, but does not comprise a complete NX
solution.  It merely provides a binary to be called by NX clients.

nxcl and qtnx provide the NX client solution in Debian and unless you know what you are doing, you should not call nxproxy directly, but use qtnx instead.
